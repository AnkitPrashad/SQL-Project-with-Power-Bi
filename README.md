Hotel Revenue and Performance Analysis Report

*Overview

The provided dashboard visualizes various key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends for hotel revenue, average daily rate (ADR), total nights, average discount, parking spaces, and cancellations over multiple years. The data is split between city hotels and resort hotels, offering insights into performance across different hotel types. This report answers three specific questions based on the data: whether hotel revenue is growing by year, if the hotel should increase parking lot space/size, and the overall trends shown by the data.

*Q1: Is the Hotel Revenue Growing by Year?

**Analysis:**
To determine if the hotel revenue is growing by year, we refer to the line chart showing the "Sum of revenue by Year, Quarter, Month, Day and hotel." This chart visualizes revenue trends over time.

**Findings:**
1. **2018:** The revenue starts at a lower level and shows moderate fluctuations throughout the year for both city and resort hotels.
2. **2019:** There is a noticeable increase in revenue, with significant peaks, particularly for resort hotels. This indicates a growth in revenue compared to 2018.
3. **2020:** The revenue continues to grow, with both city and resort hotels showing higher peaks and consistent revenue generation. Despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the overall trend indicates an upward trajectory in revenue.

**Conclusion:**
The hotel revenue is growing year by year. This is evidenced by the increasing peaks and overall upward trend in the line chart from 2018 to 2020.

* Q2: Should the Hotel Increase Parking Lot Space/Size?

**Analysis:**
To address the need for increased parking lot space, we analyze the matrix and cards showing "Sum of required_car_parkings_spaces" and "Parking Percentage."

**Findings:**
1. **Parking Spaces (2018-2020):** 
   - 2018: 1,283 spaces (2.52% parking percentage)
   - 2019: 1,908 spaces (0.95% parking percentage)
   - 2020: 2,207 spaces (2.08% parking percentage)
2. **Overall:** A total of 3.54K parking spaces are required over the three years, with a parking percentage fluctuating around 1.76%.

**Conclusion:**
The parking lot size appears to be relatively stable in terms of percentage (ranging from 0.95% to 2.52%). However, given the increase in required parking spaces over the years, there is a clear need to consider expanding parking facilities to accommodate growing demand, especially for future growth projections.

* Q3: What Trends Does the Data Show?

**Analysis:**
To identify overall trends, we consider all charts, including total revenue, ADR, total nights, average discount, cancellations, and the distribution of revenue between city and resort hotels.

**Findings:**
1. **Revenue Growth:** As previously mentioned, there is a consistent growth in revenue from 2018 to 2020.
2. **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** The ADR shows minor fluctuations but remains relatively stable around $111.44.
3. **Total Nights:** The total nights booked show seasonal peaks, likely corresponding to vacation periods, with an overall increasing trend.
4. **Average Discount:** Discounts hover around 25.99%, with minor fluctuations.
5. **Cancellations:** Cancellations also show seasonal trends but do not significantly affect the overall growth in revenue.
6. **Parking Spaces:** The need for parking spaces has grown, albeit at a fluctuating percentage rate.
7. **Hotel Type Performance:** Both city and resort hotels contribute to revenue, with resort hotels showing slightly higher peaks in revenue and required parking spaces.

**Conclusion:**
- **Seasonal Trends:** There are clear seasonal peaks in total nights and cancellations, aligning with vacation periods.
- **Revenue and Growth:** Overall revenue and required parking spaces are growing, indicating a healthy demand for hotel services.
- **Stable ADR and Discount Rates:** ADR and discount rates remain relatively stable, suggesting consistent pricing strategies.

* Recommendations

1. **Expand Parking Facilities:** Given the growing need for parking spaces, especially in 2020, expanding the parking lot would accommodate future demand and enhance guest experience.
2. **Leverage Seasonal Trends:** Capitalize on seasonal peaks by offering targeted promotions and packages to maximize occupancy and revenue.
3. **Monitor and Adjust Pricing:** Continue to monitor ADR and discount rates to ensure they remain competitive while maintaining profitability.

By analyzing these trends and metrics, hotel management can make informed decisions to drive further growth and improve operational efficiency.
